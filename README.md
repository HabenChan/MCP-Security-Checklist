## Overview

With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various new AI tools are continuously emerging. MCP (Model Context Protocol), a representative tool standard implementation, has become a critical bridge between large language models (LLMs) and external tools or data sources. Since its release at the end of 2024, MCP has been widely adopted in mainstream AI applications such as Claude Desktop and Cursor. Different MCP Server ‚Äústores‚Äù have also started to appear, showcasing a powerful ecosystem expansion capability.

However, the fast proliferation of MCP brings new security challenges. The current MCP architecture comprises three parts: **Host (the locally running AI application environment)**, **Client (the component that communicates with the Server and handles tool invocation)**, and **Server (the service side corresponding to the MCP plugin)**. Users interact with the AI via the Host; the Client parses user requests and forwards them to the MCP Server to perform tool calls or resource access. In scenarios where multiple instances and components collaborate, this architecture exposes a range of security risks, especially in sensitive contexts such as cryptocurrency transactions or LLM custom plugin adaptation.

MCP‚Äôs swift adoption highlights the importance of a **comprehensive MCP Security Checklist**. This checklist covers security considerations from user interaction interfaces, client components, server plugins, and multi-MCP collaboration mechanisms to specialized fields (e.g., cryptocurrency). It aims to help developers systematically identify potential risks and address them promptly. By implementing these security measures, one can effectively enhance the overall stability and controllability of MCP systems, ensuring that while AI applications evolve rapidly, security also keeps pace.

## How to Use

This checklist is based on possible risk points encountered during our security audits of MCP projects, aiming to help developers ensure the security of MCP implementations. We use three priority levels to denote the importance of each item:

- ![Medium][medium_img] Indicates strongly recommended items which could be omitted in special cases, but doing so might negatively impact security.
- ![High][high_img] Indicates items that must not be omitted under any circumstances; removing them may lead to system failures or security vulnerabilities.
